It is both citrusy, caramel, and has a slight hint of cinnamon, which gives it a special versatility. In summer it will invigorate, make you act and move, and in winter it will warm and relax.',

However, the combination of dark greens canonically turns into a bright light green shade, growing into banana yellow. From the yellow tones, a sudden rich pink breaks through.',
